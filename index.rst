Neural network classification of AuxTel mount tracking failures.
################################################################

.. abstract::

   For each image taken by the AuxTel, the tracking performance of the mount is monitored and analyzed.  Typically the RMS tracking errors are small, less that 0.2 arcseconds.  However, there are several problems that can cause the tracking errors to exceed this.  In this work, I built a neural network classifier that classifies the types of tracking failures based on the FFT of the tracking errors.  This was applied to all of the AuxTel data for 2023.  I believe these techniques will be useful for the Simonyi telescope as well.
